## Caesar-Cipher

This is a simple Python program to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher algorithm.

## Overview

The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a certain amount (the key). It is a type of symmetric encryption where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd caesar-cipher
   ```

3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to encrypt or decrypt a message.

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher algorithm.
- Choose the shift value (key) for encryption or decryption.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Simple and easy-to-understand command-line interface.

## Examples

Encrypting a message:

```plaintext
Enter 'e' for encrypt or 'd' for decrypt: e
Enter the message to encrypt: Hello, World!
Enter the shift value: 3
Encrypt message: Khoor, Zruog!
```

Decrypting a message:

```plaintext
Enter 'e' for encrypt or 'd' for decrypt: d
Enter the message to decrypt: Khoor, Zruog!
Enter the shift value: 3
Decrypt message: Hello, World!
```
